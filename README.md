Racket Interpreter
==================

An interpreter for a (currently small) subset of Racket, written in Java.

The idea initially started off from some assignment question in C. Features are currently pretty limited. As of now, supports binary numeric and boolean operators (can only accept strictly two arguments for now) and a small collection of unary and binary mathematical functions on numbers.
